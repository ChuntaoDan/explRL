    "> This package builds brain-inspired AI agents that simultaneously explore novel environments and map their value landscapes. It integrates autonomous navigation, unsupervised environment mapping and reinforcement learning coupled with internal drives. The starting code is ported and modified from MATLAB scripts (Ann M. Hermundstad) described in this publication: A neural circuit architecture for rapid learning in goal-directed navigation. Chuntao Dan, Brad K. Hulse, Ramya Kappagantula, Vivek Jayaraman, Ann M. Hermundstad. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.04.036. (open access)"
